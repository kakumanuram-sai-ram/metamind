hive.user_paytm_payments.p2p_inward_hourly_reporting_dataset,"data_description: This table contains hourly aggregated data for P2P (peer-to-peer) inward transactions where Virtual Payment Addresses (VPAs) are used. The table captures transaction details including transaction IDs, creation timestamps, payer handle information, and hourly time dimensions. It specifically tracks inward transactions where payments are received by Paytm from various Payment Service Providers (PSPs) including Paytm's own handles (paytm, ptyes, ptaxis, pthdfc, ptsbi) and other external PSPs. The data structure supports time-based analysis with granular hour-level tracking and includes metadata for transaction volume monitoring and trend analysis.

business_description: This table serves critical business functions for UPI P2P transaction monitoring and operational reporting. It enables real-time tracking of inward payment volumes, allowing business teams to monitor transaction trends, compare daily and monthly performance, and analyze PSP-wise distribution of incoming payments. The data supports operational dashboards for payment operations teams, helps in identifying unusual patterns or drops in transaction volumes, and provides insights for business planning and PSP relationship management. It's particularly valuable for monitoring Paytm's market share in P2P transactions and ensuring operational health of the payment ecosystem.",Hourly,UPI,hour_,"The table appears to be specifically filtered for Paytm transactions (payee_handle = 'ptyes') and includes a mechanism to track the latest available hour for data completeness monitoring. The naming convention suggests this is part of a broader reporting infrastructure for P2P payment analytics.; The table appears to be specifically designed for reporting and analytics rather than transactional processing. The naming convention suggests it's part of a broader suite of P2P reporting tables. The hourly granularity indicates real-time or near-real-time monitoring capabilities for business operations.; The table appears to be specifically designed for monitoring inward P2P transactions with a focus on PSP-wise categorization. The query shows sophisticated time-based comparisons with percentage change calculations and trend indicators (🔼🔽), suggesting this is used for executive reporting and operational monitoring. The presence of 'lastest_hour' filter indicates real-time or near real-time data processing capabilities.; The table appears to be pre-aggregated for reporting efficiency, with specific focus on Axis bank PSP transactions. The presence of 'lastest_hour' filtering suggests real-time or near real-time data availability with hourly refresh cycles.; The table name suggests this is specifically designed for reporting purposes with hourly aggregation. The SQL query shows filtering by payee_handle 'pthdfc' indicating PSP-specific analysis capabilities. The presence of comparison metrics (today vs yesterday, today vs last month) suggests this table is optimized for trend analysis and operational monitoring.; The table appears to be specifically designed for reporting and analytics purposes with pre-aggregated hourly data. The presence of 'lastest_hour' column suggests real-time or near real-time data processing capabilities. The filtering on payee_handle indicates multi-PSP support with specific focus on SBI transactions in the analyzed dashboard.","This table likely relates to other P2P payment tables including outward transactions, general P2P transaction logs, and PSP-specific reporting tables. It would commonly be joined with merchant tables, user profile tables, and payment status tables based on txn_id. The hour_ field suggests relationships with other time-series payment tables for comprehensive temporal analysis across the payment ecosystem.; This table likely relates to other P2P transaction tables (outward transactions, settlement tables) and PSP master data tables. Common joins would be with PSP configuration tables using payee_handle, transaction detail tables using txn_id for drill-down analysis, and temporal dimension tables for advanced time-series analysis. It may also connect with reconciliation and settlement tables for end-to-end transaction lifecycle tracking.; This table likely relates to other P2P transaction tables in the user_paytm_payments schema, potentially including outward P2P transactions, overall P2P summary tables, and user transaction history tables. It may be joined with user profile tables for demographic analysis and with merchant tables for understanding transaction patterns. The table serves as a source for executive dashboards and operational monitoring systems, often aggregated further for daily, weekly, and monthly reporting.; This table likely relates to broader UPI transaction ecosystem tables and may join with user profile tables, PSP mapping tables, and other P2P transaction tables (outward transactions). Common joins would be on payee_handle for PSP analysis, hour_/created_on for temporal analysis, and potentially user identifiers for customer-level analytics. It's part of the payments data pipeline that feeds into operational dashboards and regulatory reporting systems.; This table likely relates to other UPI transaction tables in the payment ecosystem, potentially joining with PSP master tables for handle mapping, user transaction tables for detailed transaction information, and settlement tables for financial reconciliation. It may be used alongside outward P2P transaction tables to provide complete P2P transaction visibility. The table could also relate to fraud monitoring tables and compliance reporting datasets. Common joins would be on transaction IDs for detailed analysis and on time dimensions for cross-functional reporting across different payment verticals.; This table likely relates to other UPI transaction tables in the user_paytm_payments schema, potentially joining with PSP master tables for handle-to-bank mapping, and transaction detail tables for drill-down analysis. It may be used alongside outward P2P transaction tables for comprehensive P2P flow analysis, and could join with user or merchant tables for demographic analysis. The hourly aggregation suggests it feeds into daily/weekly summary tables and may be sourced from real-time transaction event tables."
