hive.user_paytm_payments.p2p_inward_hourly_reporting_dataset,"data_description: This table contains hourly aggregated data for P2P (Person-to-Person) UPI inward transactions where the organization acts as the payee PSP. It stores transaction-level details including unique transaction identifiers (txn_id, krn), participant information (payer and payee handles, customer IDs), transaction amounts, and precise timestamps (created_on) with hourly granularity (hour_, lastest_hour). The table captures VPA-to-VPA (Virtual Payment Address) money transfers where funds are received from external PSPs, with comprehensive tracking of payer PSP handles to enable cross-PSP transaction analysis.

business_description: This table supports real-time operational monitoring and business intelligence for UPI P2P inward transaction flows. It enables daily transaction volume tracking, trend analysis through day-over-day and month-over-month comparisons, and competitive analysis by segmenting transactions based on payer PSPs (HDFC, AXIS, SBI, Paytm, others). The data is used for performance dashboards, operational health monitoring, revenue tracking from P2P transactions, market share analysis across different PSPs, and identifying transaction patterns throughout the day. It serves as a critical data source for payment operations teams, business analysts, and executive reporting on UPI ecosystem performance.",Hourly,UPI,created_on,"The table appears to be optimized for analytical queries with pre-computed time-based comparisons. The presence of 'lastest_hour' field suggests real-time or near real-time data ingestion. The derived columns show sophisticated business logic for calculating percentage changes between time periods, indicating this is a mature reporting dataset designed for executive dashboards and operational monitoring.","This table likely relates to other UPI transaction tables through txn_id and krn (payment reference numbers). It may join with customer master tables using payee_customer_id, PSP configuration tables using handle information, and potentially with outward P2P transaction tables to provide complete transaction flow visibility. The table serves as a key component in the broader UPI analytics ecosystem, connecting with settlement tables, dispute management systems, and regulatory reporting tables. It's commonly used alongside merchant transaction tables and wallet transaction tables to provide comprehensive payment ecosystem insights."
