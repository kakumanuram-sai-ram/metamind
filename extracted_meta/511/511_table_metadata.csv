hive.cdo.fact_upi_transactions_snapshot_v3,"data_description: This table contains comprehensive UPI transaction data with detailed information about payment transactions including transaction IDs, amounts, timestamps, customer information, payer and payee handles, bank details, PSP categorizations, transaction status, error codes, and flow categories. The table structure includes transaction identifiers, financial amounts, temporal data (transaction dates and timestamps), participant information (payer/payee handles and bank names), categorization fields (flow_category, final_category), status indicators, and metadata fields like dl_last_updated for data lineage tracking. The table appears to be a versioned snapshot (v3) containing both successful and failed UPI transactions with rich categorical data for analysis.

business_description: This table serves as the primary data source for UPI transaction monitoring and success rate analysis across different payment scenarios. It supports business operations by enabling tracking of transaction success rates across various categories like P2P (Person-to-Person), P2M (Person-to-Merchant), Scan and Pay, Online transactions, and Onus transactions. The table is critical for PSP performance monitoring, particularly for Paytm and other payment service providers, enabling business teams to analyze transaction patterns, identify failure points, monitor competitive positioning against other PSPs, and optimize payment flows. It supports regulatory reporting, business intelligence dashboards, and operational metrics tracking for the UPI ecosystem.",Daily,UPI,transaction_date_key,"This is version 3 of the UPI transactions snapshot table, indicating it has evolved over time. The table includes sophisticated business logic for PSP categorization and flow classification. The query excludes purpose code '14' which likely represents a specific transaction type that should be excluded from success rate calculations. The table supports both monthly and daily analysis patterns.; This is a snapshot table (v3) indicating it's likely an evolved version with improved data structure. The table focuses heavily on Paytm ecosystem analysis with specific handle filtering and PSP categorization logic built into the queries.; This appears to be version 3 of the UPI transactions snapshot table, indicating evolution and improvements over previous versions. The table includes sophisticated business logic for categorizing transactions and identifying PSP relationships, particularly focused on Paytm ecosystem analysis.; This is a versioned table (v3) indicating ongoing schema evolution. The table contains rich categorical data for UPI transaction analysis with specific focus on PSP-level analysis, particularly Paytm's performance against competitors. The dl_last_updated field suggests incremental data loading processes.; This is a versioned table (v3) indicating iterative improvements. The table includes comprehensive PSP handle mappings and categorizations specific to Paytm's ecosystem. The dl_last_updated column suggests delta loading capabilities for efficient data processing.","This table appears to be a central fact table in the UPI data ecosystem, likely joining with dimension tables for customer information, bank details, and merchant data. It's commonly used with date-based filtering and aggregations, suggesting relationships with calendar/date dimension tables. The table supports analysis across multiple dimensions including payer/payee handles, transaction categories, and flow types, indicating it's designed for comprehensive UPI transaction analytics and likely joins with PSP master data and transaction category lookup tables.; This fact table likely joins with dimension tables for customer details, bank master data, and PSP information. It may relate to other UPI tables for mandate transactions, settlement data, and regulatory reporting tables. The transaction_date_key suggests relationships with date dimension tables for time-based analysis. The table serves as a central hub for UPI analytics and likely feeds into aggregated summary tables for dashboard performance optimization.; This table likely serves as a core fact table in the UPI data warehouse, potentially joining with dimension tables for customer details, merchant information, and bank master data. It may be derived from or related to real-time UPI transaction tables, with this snapshot version optimized for analytical queries. The table is commonly used in conjunction with date dimensions for time-series analysis and may relate to other payment method tables for comprehensive payment analytics. It supports drill-down analysis from aggregate success rate metrics to transaction-level details.; This table likely serves as a central fact table in the UPI analytics ecosystem, potentially joining with dimension tables for customer details, bank information, and PSP master data. It may be used alongside other UPI-related tables for comprehensive transaction analysis and could be the source for aggregated summary tables used in executive reporting. The table's snapshot nature suggests it may be derived from real-time transaction tables with additional business logic applied.; This fact table likely joins with dimension tables for customer information (via customer_id), date dimensions (via transaction_date_key/day_id), and potentially PSP/bank master tables for handle mappings. It's commonly used with other UPI-related tables for comprehensive payment ecosystem analysis and may be joined with customer segmentation tables, merchant tables (for P2M analysis), and regulatory reporting tables. The table serves as a central hub for UPI transaction analysis and is likely referenced by multiple downstream analytical processes and reporting systems."
