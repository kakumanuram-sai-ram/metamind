hive.cdo.fact_upi_transactions_snapshot_v3,"data_description: This is a comprehensive UPI transactions snapshot table containing detailed transaction-level data for Unified Payments Interface transactions. The table captures essential transaction attributes including unique transaction IDs, transaction amounts, timestamps, transaction statuses (SUCCESS, DEEMED, FAILED, etc.), customer information for both payer and payee sides, UPI handles, bank names, purpose codes, error codes (both app and NPCI response codes), and flow categories. It includes derived categorizations such as P2P vs P2M classifications, payer/payee PSP categorizations, and final flow categories (P2P, SnP, Online, Onus, Others). The table structure supports both transaction-level analysis and aggregated reporting with transaction_date_key for temporal partitioning and dl_last_updated for data lineage tracking.

business_description: This table serves as the primary data source for UPI transaction monitoring, success rate analysis, and business intelligence reporting within the payments vertical. It enables calculation of key performance indicators like Success Rate (SR) which is critical for payment processor performance monitoring. The table supports various business use cases including transaction volume analysis, failure pattern identification, PSP performance comparison, flow category distribution analysis, and customer transaction behavior insights. It's particularly focused on Paytm ecosystem analysis given the handle filtering patterns. Business stakeholders use this data for operational dashboards, regulatory reporting, merchant analytics, and strategic decision-making around UPI product performance and market positioning.",Daily,UPI,transaction_date_key,"This appears to be version 3 of the UPI transactions snapshot table, indicating evolution and improvements over previous versions. The table includes sophisticated business logic for categorizing transactions and identifying PSP relationships, particularly focused on Paytm ecosystem analysis.; This is version 3 of the UPI transactions snapshot table, suggesting iterative improvements in data structure. The table includes sophisticated business logic for PSP identification and transaction categorization. The dl_last_updated field indicates delta loading capabilities for efficient data updates.; This is a snapshot table (v3) indicating it's likely an evolved version with improved data structure. The table focuses heavily on Paytm ecosystem analysis with specific handle filtering and PSP categorization logic built into the queries.; This appears to be version 3 of the UPI transactions fact table, suggesting ongoing schema evolution and optimization. The table includes sophisticated categorization logic for flow types and PSP identification. The query pattern shows heavy focus on Paytm-related transactions and success rate calculations, indicating this is likely used for operational monitoring and business performance tracking.; This is a versioned table (v3) indicating ongoing schema evolution. The table contains rich categorical data for UPI transaction analysis with specific focus on PSP-level analysis, particularly Paytm's performance against competitors. The dl_last_updated field suggests incremental data loading processes.","This table appears to be a central fact table in the UPI data ecosystem, likely joined with dimension tables for customer information, bank details, and reference data. It's commonly filtered by transaction dates, handles, and status codes for various analytical use cases. The table supports time-series analysis through transaction_date_key partitioning and integrates with other UPI-related tables for comprehensive transaction flow analysis and business reporting.; This table likely serves as a central fact table in the UPI analytics ecosystem, potentially joining with dimension tables for customer details, bank information, and PSP master data. It may be used alongside other UPI-related tables for comprehensive transaction analysis and could be the source for aggregated summary tables used in executive reporting. The table's snapshot nature suggests it may be derived from real-time transaction tables with additional business logic applied.; This fact table likely joins with dimension tables for customer information (via customer_id), date dimensions (via transaction_date_key/day_id), and potentially PSP/bank master tables for handle mappings. It's commonly used with other UPI-related tables for comprehensive payment ecosystem analysis and may be joined with customer segmentation tables, merchant tables (for P2M analysis), and regulatory reporting tables. The table serves as a central hub for UPI transaction analysis and is likely referenced by multiple downstream analytical processes and reporting systems.; This fact table likely joins with dimension tables for customer details, bank information, and transaction categorization. Common join patterns would include customer dimension tables using customer_id fields, bank/PSP dimension tables using handle or bank name fields, and date dimension tables using transaction_date_key. The table serves as a central fact table in a star schema design for UPI analytics, supporting relationships with merchant dimensions for P2M transactions, error code reference tables for failure analysis, and potentially real-time transaction tables for near real-time monitoring. It's commonly used in conjunction with other payment-related fact tables for comprehensive payment ecosystem analysis.; This table appears to be a central fact table in the UPI data ecosystem, likely joining with dimension tables for customer information, bank details, and merchant data. It's commonly used with date-based filtering and aggregations, suggesting relationships with calendar/date dimension tables. The table supports analysis across multiple dimensions including payer/payee handles, transaction categories, and flow types, indicating it's designed for comprehensive UPI transaction analytics and likely joins with PSP master data and transaction category lookup tables."
