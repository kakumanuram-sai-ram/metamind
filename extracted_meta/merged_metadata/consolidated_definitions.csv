SR,Metric / Calculated Field,"Success Rate calculated as the percentage of successful UPI transactions out of total transactions. Specifically calculated as the ratio of successful transactions (with 'SUCCESS' or 'DEEMED' status) to total overall transactions (including success, deemed, failure, and pending status). The calculation is performed as the count of transactions with DEEMED or SUCCESS status divided by total transaction count. Implementation approaches include: (1) Count of transactions with status 'DEEMED' or 'SUCCESS' divided by total transaction count, or (2) Success transactions multiplied by 100 divided by overall transactions.
